# Table

Rows and columns, with a heading. A column says how to draw a cell and, if it
likes, how wide to be.

```dart
Table<User>(
  data: users,
  columns: [
    TableColumn(title: const Text('Name'), builder: (_, u, __) => Text(u.name)),
    TableColumn(
      title: const Text('Age'),
      align: TableAlign.end,
      builder: (_, u, __) => Text('${u.age}'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

## The name

`Table` is Flutter's own as well, so a file that wants both needs to say which:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart' hide Table;   // the kit's
import 'package:seed_ui/seed_ui.dart' hide Table;    // Flutter's
```

The kit takes the plain name because that is the one people look for. `Listy`
went the other way — `List` is `dart:core`'s and there is no hiding that.

## Columns

| Field | |
| --- | --- |
| `builder` | Draws one cell: `(context, record, index)` |
| `title` | What stands at the head of the column |
| `width` | A width in logical pixels |
| `flex` | A share of what is left over |
| `align` | Which edge the cells are drawn against |
| `headerAlign` | The same for the heading. Defaults to `align` |
| `ellipsis` | Cuts the text rather than letting it wrap |

There is no key into a map to get wrong: `T` is your own row type and the
builder is handed one.

### How wide a column is

**Say nothing and it fits its content** — the column takes the width of its
widest cell, which is what a table is expected to do and needs writing
nowhere.

Whatever is left over after that goes to the automatic columns, shared between
them. A `width` is exact and a `flex` is a share, so:

```dart
TableColumn(title: const Text('Name'), width: 120, builder: ...)  // 120, exactly
TableColumn(title: const Text('City'), flex: 1, builder: ...)     // one part
TableColumn(title: const Text('Age'), flex: 2, builder: ...)      // of three
```

A column may name one or the other, never both — one is a number of pixels and
the other a share of what is left.

## Size

`size` takes a preset or a height of your own.

```dart
Table(size: SoftSize.small, ...)                  // dense
Table(size: const ControlSize.height(64), ...)    // rows 64 tall
```

A preset says how much padding a cell carries and lets the content decide the
rest. A number says how tall the row is, so the vertical padding stands aside
rather than adding to it — and it is a floor, so a cell that needs more still
gets it.

## Around the rows

| Prop | |
| --- | --- |
| `bordered` | An outline, and rules between the columns |
| `showHeader` | Whether the heading row is drawn |
| `header`, `footer` | Drawn above and below, and handed the rows |
| `empty` | What stands in when there are no rows |
| `loading` | Lays a `Spin` over the table |
| `rowHoverable` | Whether a row lights up under the pointer |
| `onRowTap` | Called with the record and its index |

With no rows the heading stays — the columns are still worth showing — and the
kit's `Empty` takes the space below it. `ConfigProvider.emptyBuilder` is asked
first, under `EmptySlot.table`, so a kit-wide placeholder covers tables too.

## Tokens

| Token | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `headerBg`, `headerColor` | the heading row |
| `rowHoverBg` | the row under the pointer |
| `borderColor` | `colorSplit` |
| `cellPaddingBlock`, `cellPaddingBlockSM`, `cellPaddingBlockLG` | 12, 8, 16 |
| `cellPaddingInline`, `cellPaddingInlineSM`, `cellPaddingInlineLG` | 16, 8, 20 |
| `footerBg`, `borderRadius`, `fontSize` | |

## Not here yet

Sorting, filtering, row selection, expandable rows, pagination, fixed columns
and a sticky header are still to come. They are being built in that order.
